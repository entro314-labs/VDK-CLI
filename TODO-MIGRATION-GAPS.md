# VDK CLI AI Context Schema Migration - Implementation Gaps

## Overview
This document tracks the remaining implementation gaps identified during the comprehensive verification of the VDK CLI migration to AI Context Schema v2.1.0.

## üîß Critical Implementation Gaps

### 1. Platform Configuration Flow
**Status**: ‚ùå Missing  
**Files**: `src/scanner/core/RuleGenerator.js`, `src/scanner/core/RuleAdapter.js`  
**Priority**: High

**Issue**: The RuleGenerator loads blueprint frontmatter but doesn't extract platform-specific configurations and pass them to the RuleAdapter.

**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ RuleAdapter supports `platformConfig` parameter with comprehensive platform-specific features
- ‚úÖ Blueprint schema defines platform configurations (globs, characterLimit, priority, etc.)
- ‚ùå RuleGenerator calls `adaptRules()` with empty `platformConfig={}`
- ‚ùå Platform-specific features not being utilized

**Required Changes**:
```javascript
// In RuleGenerator.js - lines 160-171
// Current:
adaptedRules = await this.ruleAdapter.adaptRules(
  standardizedRules,
  this.mapIntegrationToIDE(integration.name),
  analysisData
)

// Needed:
const platformConfig = this.extractPlatformConfig(rule.frontmatter, integration.name)
adaptedRules = await this.ruleAdapter.adaptRules(
  standardizedRules,
  this.mapIntegrationToIDE(integration.name),
  analysisData,
  platformConfig
)
```

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Add `extractPlatformConfig(frontmatter, platformName)` method to RuleGenerator
- [ ] Update all `adaptRules()` calls to pass platform configuration
- [ ] Test platform-specific features (globs, character limits, priorities)

### 2. Blueprint Dependency Resolution System
**Status**: ‚ùå Missing  
**Files**: `src/scanner/core/RuleGenerator.js`  
**Priority**: Medium

**Issue**: Blueprint relationship fields (requires, suggests, conflicts, supersedes) are validated but not processed during rule generation.

**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ Schema validation for relationship fields exists
- ‚úÖ Relationship conflict detection implemented
- ‚ùå No dependency graph resolution during rule loading
- ‚ùå Rules not filtered/reordered based on dependencies

**Required Implementation**:
1. **Dependency Graph Builder**:
   ```javascript
   buildDependencyGraph(rules) {
     // Create dependency graph from relationship fields
     // Handle requires, suggests, conflicts, supersedes
   }
   ```

2. **Dependency Resolution**:
   ```javascript
   resolveDependencies(rules, availableBlueprints) {
     // Filter rules based on requirements and conflicts
     // Order rules based on dependency chain
     // Handle missing dependencies
   }
   ```

3. **Integration with Rule Loading**:
   ```javascript
   async loadStandardizedRules(analysisData = {}) {
     const rawRules = await this.loadRulesFromDisk()
     const resolvedRules = await this.resolveDependencies(rawRules)
     return resolvedRules
   }
   ```

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Design dependency resolution algorithm
- [ ] Implement blueprint dependency graph building
- [ ] Add dependency filtering and ordering logic
- [ ] Handle circular dependencies and conflicts
- [ ] Add verbose logging for dependency resolution
- [ ] Write tests for dependency resolution scenarios

## üöÄ Phases 5-7 Implementation Plan

### Phase 5: CLI and Tooling Updates
- [ ] Update CLI commands to support new schema structure
- [ ] Update documentation and help text for new schema capabilities  
- [ ] Create migration tool to convert existing blueprints to new schema format

### Phase 6: VDK Hub Integration
- [ ] Update VDK Hub to support new schema format
- [ ] Migrate VDK Blueprints repository to new schema format
- [ ] Update remote blueprint fetching logic for new schema

### Phase 7: Testing and Documentation  
- [ ] Comprehensive testing across all 33+ platforms with new schema
- [ ] Update all example blueprints and documentation
- [ ] Performance testing with large blueprint repositories

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priority**: Fix Platform Configuration Flow (#1)
   - This unlocks the full potential of the new schema features
   - Relatively straightforward implementation

2. **Medium Priority**: Implement Dependency Resolution (#2)  
   - More complex but important for blueprint ecosystem
   - Can be implemented incrementally

3. **Continue with Phases 5-7**: Proceed with CLI updates and ecosystem migration
   - Can be done in parallel with gap fixes
   - Focus on user-facing improvements

## üîç Testing Strategy

### Platform Configuration Testing
```bash
# Test platform-specific features
vdk scan --verbose --platform claude
vdk scan --verbose --platform cursor  
vdk scan --verbose --platform windsurf
```

### Dependency Resolution Testing
```bash
# Test with blueprints that have dependencies
vdk validate --check-dependencies
vdk scan --resolve-dependencies --verbose
```
