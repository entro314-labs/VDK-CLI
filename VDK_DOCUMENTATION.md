# VDK CLI (Vibe Development Kit) - Technical Documentation

## Project Overview

**Project:** VDK-CLI (Vibe Development Kit Command-Line Interface)

**Purpose:** The VDK-CLI is a sophisticated developer tool designed to analyze software projects and generate customized "rules" that provide deep, project-specific context to AI coding assistants. By understanding a project's unique characteristics—technology stack, architecture, naming conventions, and coding patterns—the VDK-CLI enables AI assistants to provide more accurate, consistent, and contextually relevant suggestions.

**Core Value:** Bridges the gap between project-specific knowledge and AI assistance, making AI coding assistants "project-aware" and significantly more effective for developers working on specific codebases.

## Core Functionality

The VDK-CLI performs several key functions:

- **Project Analysis**: Scans codebases to understand structure, technologies, patterns, and conventions
- **Technology Detection**: Identifies programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and build tools
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detects naming conventions, architectural patterns, and code organization strategies
- **Rule Generation**: Creates customized AI rules based on comprehensive project analysis
- **IDE Integration**: Sets up connections with various IDEs to enable AI assistants to use generated rules
- **Rule Management**: Fetches and updates rules from a central repository (VDK Hub)

## Architecture and Core Components

### CLI Interface (`cli.js`)
- Provides primary commands: `init`, `update`, `deploy`, `status`
- Handles command-line arguments and options
- Orchestrates workflow between all components
- Built using the `commander` npm package

### Scanner Engine (`src/scanner/engine.js`)
- Central orchestrator for scanning and rule generation processes
- Coordinates work between specialized components
- Handles file system operations and configuration management
- Supports both basic and deep scanning modes

### Core Analysis Components

#### ProjectScanner (`src/scanner/core/ProjectScanner.js`)
**What it does:** Traverses the entire codebase to build a comprehensive project map
**How it works:**
- Uses `glob` for efficient file and directory scanning
- Respects `.gitignore` rules and ignore patterns
- Categorizes files by type (configuration, documentation, javascript, stylesheet, etc.)
- Builds hierarchical representation of project structure
- Performs dependency analysis for deep scanning
- Collects metadata about files and directories

#### TechnologyAnalyzer (`src/scanner/core/TechnologyAnalyzer.js`)
**What it does:** Identifies the project's complete technology stack
**How it works:**

- Analyzes dependencies to detect frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)
- Identifies libraries (Express, Django), build tools (Webpack, Vite)
- Detects testing frameworks and development tools
- Aggregates technology stack information for rule generation

#### PatternDetector (`src/scanner/core/PatternDetector.js`)

**How it works:**
- Uses Handlebars templates for flexible rule generation
- Creates different rule types (core agent, project context, error prevention)
- Customizes rules based on detected technologies and patterns
- Generates markdown files with detailed AI instructions
- Saves generated files to appropriate IDE-specific locations

## Analysis Pipeline

The VDK-CLI's core functionality is orchestrated by the `vdk init` command through a multi-stage pipeline:

# VibeKit-VDK-AI-Rules: Technical Product Report

## Executive Summary

VibeKit-VDK-AI-rules is a configuration framework that transforms generic AI assistants into specialized development tools. Rather than being executable software, it functions as a structured rule system that defines AI behavior, knowledge boundaries, and response patterns for software development tasks.

## Product Architecture

### Core Structure
The framework operates through a hierarchical system of markdown configuration files (.mdc) containing YAML metadata and instructional content. The architecture follows a clear separation of concerns:

**Foundation Layer (Core Rules)**
- `00-core-agent.mdc`: Establishes AI persona, response formatting, and operational modes
- `01-project-context.mdc`: Template for project-specific technology stack and conventions
- `02-common-errors.mdc`: Anti-pattern documentation to prevent known mistakes
- `03-mcp-configuration.mdc`: Defines available Model Context Protocol servers and tool integrations

**Specialization Layers**
- `tasks/`: 60+ task-specific rule files for development activities
- `technologies/`: Framework and library-specific implementation guidelines
- `languages/`: Programming language best practices and syntax rules
- `stacks/`: Pre-configured combinations for common technology stacks
- `assistants/`: Platform-specific adaptations for different AI tools

### Technical Implementation

**File Format Specification**
Each .mdc file contains:
- YAML frontmatter with metadata (version, compatibility, glob patterns)
- Structured markdown defining behavioral rules and technical guidelines
- Code examples and anti-patterns
- Reference links to related rule files

**Rule Activation System**
Rules activate through multiple triggers:
- File path matching via glob patterns
- Explicit user requests for specific tasks
- AI-determined relevance based on context analysis
- Cross-references between related rule files

**Context Management**
The framework implements strategic context handling:
- Token-aware chunking for large codebases
- Progressive generation starting with interfaces
- Sectional editing for complex file modifications
- State preservation across development sessions

## Functional Capabilities
