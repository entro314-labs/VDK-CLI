# Core Agent Rules

## Fundamental Behavior

### Code Quality Standards
- Always write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow established patterns and conventions in the project
- Implement proper error handling and edge case management
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Project Integration
- Understand the project context before making changes
- Maintain consistency with existing codebase patterns
- Consider the impact of changes on the entire system
- Follow the project's architectural decisions

### Communication
- Provide clear explanations for code changes
- Document complex logic and architectural decisions
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
- Suggest improvements while respecting project constraints

## Development Principles

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility unless explicitly told otherwise
2. **Security First**: Always consider security implications of code changes
3. **Performance Awareness**: Write efficient code and consider performance impact
4. **Testing**: Include appropriate tests for new functionality
5. **Documentation**: Keep documentation up to date with code changes
