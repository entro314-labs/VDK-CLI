other

- **The project has been rebranded from 'Vibe Coding Rules' to 'VibeKit VDK CLI', updating all documentation, configuration, and code references to reflect the new name and branding.** (5d39fb0) (90%)
  - This commit performs a comprehensive rebranding across the codebase, renaming all instances of 'Vibe Coding Rules' to 'VibeKit VDK CLI' in documentation, configuration files, environment variables, and source code comments. It introduces new and updated documentation (including CLI reference and getting started guides), removes outdated docs, and updates project structure and metadata to align with the new branding. No core logic or APIs are changed, but configuration and environment variable names are updated, and all user and contributor-facing materials are refreshed.
  - Complete rebranding to 'VibeKit VDK CLI' across all files and documentation
  - Updated environment variables, configuration, and project metadata

- **Renamed the project and all related references from CodePilotRules to VibeCodingRules across configuration, documentation, scripts, and assets.** (7a4b082) (90%)
  - This commit systematically updates the project name and repository links from CodePilotRules to VibeCodingRules throughout the codebase, including configuration files, environment variables, documentation, scripts, and metadata. No functional logic or APIs were changed, but all identifiers, URLs, and references now reflect the new project branding.
  - Renamed all instances of CodePilotRules to VibeCodingRules in documentation, configs, and scripts
  - Updated repository URLs, badges, and environment variables to match new branding
  - No changes to application logic or user-facing features

  - This commit introduces a large-scale renaming and restructuring of configuration files, documentation (including new installation and sync system guides), and internal rule definitions. It updates setup scripts, package commands, and dependency locks, while removing or relocating numerous AI rule files and assistant configurations. The changes enhance the onboarding process, clarify project setup, and streamline rule management, but require careful attention to new file locations and updated configuration paths.
  - Added detailed installation and sync system documentation
  - Refactored and relocated numerous AI rule and assistant configuration files
  - Updated setup wizard and package scripts for improved onboarding
  - **Migration**: Review and update any custom scripts or integrations that reference old rule or configuration file paths. Follow the new INSTALLATION.md and SYNC-SYSTEM.md guides for setup and synchronization. Reinstall dependencies as package and lock files have changed.

- **Introduces and updates a comprehensive set of 'Vibe Coding Rules' to standardize AI assistant behavior and coding practices across multiple tools and workflows.** üî• (3100b83) (90%)
  - This change significantly expands and revises the rule set for AI-powered development workflows, adding new assistant-specific guidelines (for Claude, JetBrains, VS Code, Zed), updating task and language rules, and refining core principles. The update touches over 160 files, introduces new configuration and validation patterns, and includes security, authentication, and performance-related improvements. No direct user-facing features are added, but the groundwork is laid for more consistent, secure, and efficient AI-assisted development across the codebase.
  - Added assistant-specific rules for Claude, JetBrains, VS Code, and Zed
  - Updated core, project, and language rules to version 2.1.0 with enhanced security and validation

  - This initial commit introduces the foundational architecture for an AI developer assistant project, adding 109 files and nearly 19,000 lines. It establishes core agent instructions, project context, error handling templates, language-specific best practices (TypeScript, Python, Swift, Kotlin, C++), and stack-specific guidelines (Astro, E-commerce). The commit also includes configuration for AI assistant integrations (Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. These files define coding standards, security protocols, data validation, authentication/authorization patterns, and integration points, laying the groundwork for scalable, maintainable, and secure AI-driven development workflows.
  - Introduces core AI agent rules and project context templates
  - Adds language and stack-specific best practices for TypeScript, Python, Swift, Kotlin, C++, Astro, and E-commerce
  - Configures AI assistant integrations and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers
  - **Migration**: As this is the initial commit, all future development must align with the established rules and configurations. For existing projects adopting this baseline, review and adapt directory structures, configuration files, and coding standards as needed. Migration may require aligning database schemas, authentication flows, and deployment pipelines with the new standards.
