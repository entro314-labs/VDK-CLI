## ðŸ”§ Working Directory Changes

- (feature) Enhanced exclusion logic in RuleGenerator.js - Updated the RuleGenerator class to add comprehensive exclusion rules for irrelevant languages based on project type. For web projects (isWebProject), files related to mobile (swift, kotlin, java, dart, flutter, xamarin) and system programming languages (cpp, c++, rust, go, c#, csharp) are now entirely excluded by returning 0. For content/documentation projects (isContentProject), stricter filtering was added: only Astro, TypeScript, and basic web technologies are allowed, with heavy penalties applied to files from unrelated stacks (e.g., nextjs, react, vue, supabase, trpc, python, swift, kotlin, cpp, node, express) by reducing the score by 0.8. Changes affect the main rule generation logic, utilizing detectedFrameworks, isWebProject, and fileName checks.

- (docs) Created AI_CHANGELOG.md file - Added initial changelog documentation with release summary, business impact, complexity assessment, and categorized change entries. Included detailed descriptions for documentation updates and other changes, as well as a reference to the ai-changelog-generator tool.
